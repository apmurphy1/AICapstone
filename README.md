In my project, I've developed a simple yet powerful model to predict how many medals each country might win in the Olympics. By analysing past Olympic data, including factors like the number of athletes and historical performance, my model can make predictions about a country's medal count. I've crafted this model to be easy to understand, even for those without a technical background. My aim is to provide clear and transparent insights that can help inform decisions about Olympic performance. Through my model, I hope to build trust and facilitate better decision-making in the world of sports but more importantly to provide an easy and tangible example to non-technical decision makers on what AI & ML are as concept, how they can be measured and the key steps in producing an AI / ML model.
